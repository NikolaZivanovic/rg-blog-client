# Get Started

## Initial Machine Setup

1. **Install [Node 4.0.0 or greater](https://nodejs.org)**

    (5.0 or greater is recommended for optimal build performance)
    Need to run multiple versions of Node? Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.

3. **[Disable safe write in your editor](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#adjusting-your-text-editor)** to assure hot reloading works properly.

4. Complete the steps below for your operating system:

    ### macOS

    * Install [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) via `brew install watchman` or fswatch via `brew install fswatch` to avoid [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/871) which occurs if your macOS has no appropriate file watching service installed.

    ### Linux

    * Run this to [increase the limit](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16748737/grunt-watch-error-waiting-fatal-error-watch-enospc) on the number of files Linux will watch. [Here's why](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/issues/6).

        `echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`.

    ### Windows
    
    * **Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**. Some node modules may rely on node-gyp, which requires Python on Windows.
    * **Install C++ Compiler**. Browser-sync requires a C++ compiler on Windows.
    
      [Visual Studio Express](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-US/products/visual-studio-express-vs) comes bundled with a free C++ compiler.
      
      If you already have Visual Studio installed:
      Open Visual Studio and go to File -> New -> Project -> Visual C++ -> Install Visual C++ Tools for Windows Desktop.
      The C++ compiler is used to compile browser-sync (and perhaps other Node modules).
      
5. **`Clone project` via `git clone`**
   
6. **Install global dependencies: `npm i -g yarn`**   
   
7. **Install dependencies via `yarn install`**
   
8. **Run development server with `npm run start`**

## Good CHANGELOG guiding principles

### Guiding Principles
    - Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
    - There should be an entry for every single version.
    - The same types of changes should be grouped.
    - Versions and sections should be linkable.
    - The latest version comes first.
    - The release date of each version is displayed.
    - Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

### Types of changes
- **Added** for new features.
- **Changed** for changes in existing functionality.
- **Removed** for now removed features.
- **Refactored** for changing readability of code but not changing functionality.
- **Fixed** for any bug fixes.
